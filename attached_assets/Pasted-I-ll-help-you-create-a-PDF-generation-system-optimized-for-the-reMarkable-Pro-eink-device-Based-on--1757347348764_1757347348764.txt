I’ll help you create a PDF generation system optimized for the reMarkable Pro eink device. Based on your images, I can see you need a weekly overview followed by individual daily pages. Let me create a comprehensive solution.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Now let me create the backend integration code that you can use in your Replit application to handle the PDF generation with your actual calendar data:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Now let me create a client-side integration example that shows how to connect this with your existing Replit calendar application:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Finally, let me create the setup instructions and package.json dependencies for your Replit application:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I’ve created a comprehensive PDF generation system optimized specifically for your reMarkable Pro eink device! Here’s what I’ve built for you:
